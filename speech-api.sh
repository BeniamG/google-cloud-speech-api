# To do
# 1. Setup (one time only) 

# enable the APIs: speech, compute engine, cloud storage

# create a service account 

# download the service account key file to your laptop, then upload it to google cloud shell

# set variable for file name

# make sure for the default test to download this file and upload it to your own bucket:
#  gsutil cp gs://cloud-samples-tests/speech/brooklyn.flac .

## by hand run this command with whatever your key is called
## (replace foo-key.json with the name of your key):
##
##    cp $HOME/foo-key.json $HOME/simple-test-key.json

# points to the service account key file
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/simple-test-key.json

# gets a new access token based on the service account key file
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)

# This edits the metadata the API expects.  make sure itâ€™s the same as the file you are converting.
